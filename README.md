# Authsignal's Azure AD B2C Passwordless Integration Example

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and uses the Azure AD B2C Provider from [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) to handle authentication.

**The focus of this repository is to demonstrate how to use Authsignal with Azure AD B2C by adding steps to custom policies.**

A live demo can be viewed here: [Live Demo](https://as-azure-ad-b2c-passwordless-example.vercel.app)  
The custom policies used in this demo can be viewed here: [Custom Policies](./policies/)
